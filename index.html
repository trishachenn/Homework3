        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Trisha Chennuru and I'm excited to welcome you to my personal
            website! I'm currently a third year at Northeastern University in Boston and am 
            studying Data Science and Business with a concentration in Marketing. Ever since I first arrived 
            on campus in the fall of 2023, Boston has truly become my second home. One of my favorite parts 
            about living here has been exploring the city’s vibrant and ever-evolving restaurant scene. 
            From cozy cafés in the South End to hidden gems in Allston and waterfront seafood spots in Seaport, 
            Boston offers an endless variety of flavors and experiences that make every meal feel like an adventure. 
            Having grown up in Brookfield, CT there was never many new restaurants to try. Those outings became 
            some of my favorite memories — trying everything from street food to Michelin-starred restaurants, always 
            guided by my mom, who’s the ultimate foodie. Her passion for food definitely rubbed off on me, and now it’s 
            something we continue to bond over, especially when we travel together. I would say that my 
            favorite cuisine is Italian as it's so versatile. This was just further confirmed when I went 
            to Italy for my Sixteenth birthday and got to try all the different pasta, pizza, and seafood 
            options. I hope you enjoy my website, as I am very excited to create it and share more about 
            the food scene in Boston!</p>
